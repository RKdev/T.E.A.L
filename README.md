The Extensible Adaptable Learning Framework

This is a pet project I've been wanting to work on for years. The idea is a learning management system focused around self-study.

I originally conceived of the idea as a way of managing how to read all the books I have. As I played around with it, I decided I wanted
to extend the concept to more than just library books to any kind of resource, ie. youtube videos, online classes, wikipedia articles, etc.
From a usage standpoint I want to try and combine the usability of Pinterest
with the spaced-learning system in Anki.

I'm also using this project as a learning platform for web development in general. It contains a tiny node.js instance for learning server-side code.

I should mention that this is a giant work-in-progress and will probably be
broken half the time.

~~My goal is to have a working beta of the system up by March.~~

UPDATE:

I know the readme file isn't a blog, but I feel like it's the easiest place to
put project updates.

I had gotten pretty far when I decided that I wanted to reorganize everything. I
think this was a good decision because the next objects I want to create will be
based heavily on the **categories** object.  Right now I want to get the logic
for **topics**  and finally **resources** in place.  The next step will be to
integrate with Aanki.  At that point I will consider the project in Beta and
will see if I can get people to start testing.
