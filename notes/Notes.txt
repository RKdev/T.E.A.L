To Do

Ability to create new resource objects and add them to the resource array

Conceptual Questions
What happens to a resource ID when a resource is removed?




ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE - could not find machine

Categories, Topics, and Resources will be a different shade (from blue to red) depending on when last review has

Things not to do:
/*      for(var i = 0; i < tempArray.length; i++){
        for(var key in tempArray[i]){
          if(tempArray[i].hasOwnProperty(key)){
            if(tempArray[i][key].indexOf(query) !== -1){
              returnArray.push(tempArray[i]);
            }
          }
        }
      }*/
storing an array of objects into a temp array is unnecessary

Add record
 record types
  hierarchy
  note
  flash card
  

The review algorithm will crawl through the hierarchy tree and track that youâ€™ve reviewed everything in that branch of the hierarchy
