first to have conceived these numbers,[5][6] Rafael Bombelli first set down the rules for multiplication of complex numbers in 1572. The concept had appeared in print earlier, for instance in work by Gerolamo Cardano. At the time, such numbers were poorly understood and regarded by some as fictitious or useless, much as zero and the negative numbers once were. Many other mathematicians were slow to adopt the use of imaginary numbers, including René Descartes, who wrote about them in his La Géométrie, where the term imaginary was used and meant to be derogatory.[7][8] The use of imaginary numbers was not widely accepted until the work of Leonhard Euler (1707–1783) and Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855). The geometric significance of complex numbers as points in a plane was first described by Caspar Wessel (1745–1818).[9]\n\nIn 1843 William Rowan Hamilton extended the idea of an axis of imaginary numbers in the plane to a four-dimensional space of quaternion imaginaries, in which three of the dimensions are analogous to the imaginary numbers in the complex field.\n\nWith the development of quotient rings of polynomial rings, the concept behind an imaginary number became more substantial, but then one also finds other imaginary numbers such as the j of tessarines which has a square of +1. This idea first surfaced with the articles by James Cockle beginning in 1848.[10]\n","parent":"1483067180504732","type":"note"},{"name":"Note: Definition","date":1483814072249,"id":"1483814072249768","cycle":0,"data":"","parent":"1483067171721690","type":"note"},{"name":"Note: Laws for Radicals","date":1483814078625,"id":"1483814078625493","cycle":0,"data":"A. a radicand raised to it's root (index) power is itself\n\nB. the nth root of two factors is the nth root of each factor multiplied together\n\nC. the nth root of a fraction is the nth root of each fractional part divided \n\nD. the nth root of a ^ m n_rad(a^m) is similar to rule A.
